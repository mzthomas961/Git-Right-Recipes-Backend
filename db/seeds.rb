SautÃ© onions and celery until fragrant and translucent. Take your timeâ€”remember, this is where your real flavor begins.
    2. Add the garlic, zucchini and green beans and give them a little sautÃ©, too. This step will deepen their flavor a bit before the soup gets all liquidy. A layer of flavor.
    3. Pour in everything else and bring the pot of soup to a boil.
    4. Turn it to a low simmer and cover the pot. Simmer for about half an hour, until the vegetables are super tender and it looks like vegetable soup youâ€™d like to eat!
    5. Eat! We like to serve it topped with lots of freshly grated Parmigiano and fresh basil.",
